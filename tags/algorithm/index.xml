      <description>&lt;p&gt;I found an interesting story about Robin Hood when I first learned about Robin Hood Hash(and there is another RobinHood that provides financial services, which I don&amp;rsquo;t believe is a coincidence). Robin Hood was a bandit, but he was a good guy who robbed the rich in order to give to the poor. And that implies the basic idea behind Robin Hood Hash.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically, hash table has two different ways to store the key-value pairs. The one is separate chaining and the other is open addressing. Robin Hood Hashing is a variation of open addressing in hash tables. It aims to minimize the variance in probe sequence lengths by ensuring that elements with longer probe sequences &amp;ldquo;steal&amp;rdquo; slots from elements with shorter probe sequences. This approach helps balance the load and reduces clustering, improving overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
